# WIBBLE ðŸ” 

Wibble is a word game based on the Discord Activity called Spellcast. The
concept is a tile-matching game where you chain together Scrabble tiles to build
words.

This project is being worked on as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills
in Front End Web Development. In this repository, you'll find the source code for
Wibble, as well as the daily logs I kept during development. To learn more about
the development of Wibble, you can check out the series of dev logs I wrote on
[my blog](https://jrm.dev) about the process.

Wibble is live and [hosted on Vercel](https://wibble.vercel.app).
